## Short description of the idea
Web app for image cataloging, categorization and recognicion using Machine Learning.
One of its features is option of manual segmentation, which means you choose yourself what part of the picture you want to label for our self-learning model. 
We might implement automatic segmentation as well, and this means that picture segments itself and you rearrange boxes and then label them.
In this repository under /doc/ directory
you can find mockup of the front-end part as interactive PDF file or preffered .bmpr (Balsamiq Wireframes 4 file).
