## ML Study Report
Project goal is object classification.

To automatize this process we plan to use area known as machine learning.
We plan to use convolutional neural network (CNN) cause of their use vide in this area, a lot of learning materials and effectiveness.  
CNN on the input receives photo presented as array of color values. 
We choose CNN over RNN cause the second is more used to work on sequential data.

Problem concerns supervised learning cause we will provide the training set with will be used to teach the model to recognize objects then we will use test set to test the model in categorizing objects. Model will be used as a part of bigger program. Machine learning model will be the part of the project responsible for categorizing the objects.
